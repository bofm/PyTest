You've just installed PyTest. That's awesome, to get it working though you
should read the full [README](https://github.com/kaste/PyTest).


Please look at the settings: `Preferences > Package Settings > PyTest Runner`.

Try some commands! Open up the command palette (`ctrl+shift+P`) and start typing `PyTest`.

By now, the plugin should have tweaked your theme, so you get red/green
notifications after each test run. Follow the instructions online, if you
don't see them. You'll love'em.


Consider adding a keyboard shortcut to toggle the output panel, which will show the 'normal' pytest output, you're used to look at.

    { "keys": ["ctrl+'"], "command": "pytest_toggle_panel" },
